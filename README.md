# SAFAS 

Safas is **s**edimentation **a**nd **f**loc **a**nalysis **s**oftware, a Python module for processing and interpretation of images and videos of flocs, a.k.a. aggregates, a.k.a. cohesive sediments.

This package permits the direct analysis of images and videos of flocs. Size, morphology and settling rate information may be measured from videos and saved in an easily accessible format.

See https://safas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for documentation of the installation and use of SAFAS software.

## Why Safas?
**Safas** is written in Python. It is open-source and the image filters are accessible and extensible. The image filters use functions from  and were designed and tested for segmenting and quantifying images of flocs.

* **"One-step" analysis.** The user can open a video file and directly process the frames. The results may exported to an .xlsx file in tabular format for analysis or reporting.

* **Optimized floc filters.** Image analysis can be challenging and each image class often requires a different treatment. The pre-defined filters are built on OpenCV and Scikit-Image and have been designed to work well with images of flocs.

* **GPU-enabled.** Several filters in Safas are GPU-enabled, through OpenCV with OpenCL, if the software environment is configured correctly during installation.
